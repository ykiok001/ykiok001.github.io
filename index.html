        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello my name is Yuki Kioka and I am a third year university student who is currently attending the University of California, Riverside. 
I am majoring in Psychology with an interest in clinical and forensic psychology. 


Born and raised in Mountain View, California, my academic journey began in the heart of the Bay Area. My fascination for psychology began with a deep fascination for different emotions and personalities. This interest led me to pursue a Bachelor of Arts degree in Psychology at the University of California, Riverside. During my academic journey, I not only gained a solid foundation in Cognitive and social psychology, but I also actively participated in sociocultural clubs which allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios through club activities and integrating with the general club members.



Upon high school graduation, I embarked on a dynamic career that has taken me across various roles and industries within the psychology field. I started my professional journey at youth summer camp counselor. I quickly established myself as a senior group leader, using my interpersonal skills as well as communication skills with both children and parents alike. I also worked in the physical therapy department of a nearby clinic as a receptionist/aid with invaluable insights into communications and aiding patients daily concerns and emotions while assisting the therapists in cleaning, prepping, and scheduling patients into open session times, solidifying my commitment to excellence and innovation. As of now in college, I am working as a Boba barista at Tenren's teatime in Riverside. Using both communication skills with the employees as well as the customers, I aid in the cashier, server and barista positions 


Throughout my career, I have developed a robust skill set that includes sublime communication skills with any age and background. Working with both parents as well as students gave me the experience of dealing with different people from different backgrounds as well as age. I also have proficiency in English and Japanese at a native level and my ability to adapt quickly to new challenges have been instrumental in my success. Very high intrapersonal relationships as well as quick decision-making and working well through pressure has developed me to become a very spoken leader in many situations. 


In every endeavor, I bring a combination of creativity, strategic thinking, and a relentless pursuit of excellence. I believe in striving for greatness, and I am driven by the desire to always be the best to help others in need. My approach is collaborative, and I thrive in environments that foster innovation, teamwork, and a commitment to continuous improvement.



As I continue to evolve in my professional journey, I am excited about my psychology career. Whether it's becoming a research assistant at a psychology lab, creating a more unique field of study in psychology, or picking up a third language, I am dedicated to staying at the forefront of psychology and contributing meaningfully to its growth.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I invite you to explore the various facets of my professional journey, and I look forward to the possibility of collaborating on future endeavors.<br><br>
